    <description>When you use the VUs load type, the load profile settings specify the number of virtual users working on the server simultaneously. This number can be permanent during the entire test run, or it can change as specified in the selected load profile. When a virtual user stops working because the test case is over, LoadUI starts a new user to maintain the needed number of virtual users.</description>

    <description>In LoadUI, there are several ways to specify the load simulated by each scenario. This is called Load allocation. You can enter the total number of users and select what portion of them runs each scenario (Relative allocation), run the same number of virtual users for all scenarios (Equal allocation) or enter the number of users in each scenario individually (Per scenario allocation).</description>

    <description>LoadUI uses agents to distribute load to other computers. Load agents run on a physical computer where the LoadUI Agent application is installed. Cloud agents run in the cloud.</description>

    <description>Failure is a generic term for all issues that cause a simulated user to fail. For example, a test can have failures when load test assertions fail or a test step does not receive a response.</description>

    <description>LoadUI runs SoapUI test cases to simulate user behavior. The test cases simulated in a scenario are called targets.</description>
